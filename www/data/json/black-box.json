In this analogy the paper represents our moldable minds: When our ideals are challenged our mind can either, reject them and hold to that previous idea we had, turning into a rock; or be open to these new arguments and change like a paper being cut and adopting a new form. The visual and verbal language is also present in this project, through the adaption of this oriental game to the Hispanic culture, resulting in some verbal alterations.",

    "Description (short paragraph about the piece) Not required": "In some ways, our bodies are only vessels, preserving voices, images, languages, and all the intangible but perceivable matter and passing them on for generations. We breathe in, breathe out, while something's threading beneath our skins and bones, through thousands of years, and weaving a pulsing panorama. This \"something\" is the source of everything, the essence of life, which is long pursued from the very start of all the existing cultures. From the ancient period, classical elements discussing the essential components of the cosmos among different civilizations were astonishingly similar. In Greece, Ancient Egypt, Persia, Babylonia, Japan, Tibet, and India, though in various languages, the lists were almost the same: water, earth, fire, air (wind), and aether (void). In the Chinese Wu Xing system, slightly different is that the Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water are transitional energies derived from (wind or air) Qi's movement. What if we put aside theories, the belief in science, and even words' connotations; just attend to the bodily senses, try to perceive, and use anything other than language to define the universal essence.\n\nThis video is a collage of films (Andrei Rublev and Nostalgia by Andrei Tarkovsky), recorded vocals (selected texts from poems by ZhangZao and Haizi, novels by Roberto Bolaño and Olga Tokarczuk, and lines in Isaiah 50 recited by friends), videos, photos, and soundtrack from online resources.",

    "Description (short paragraph about the piece) Not required": "Comparing the portrayed violence of direct resistance actions such as shoplifting and \"looting\" with the actual violence of gentrification and capitalism. This video also serves as documentation of a performance in which I recorded the sound of myself destroying shoplifted items from stores contributing to the gentrification of Chicago neighborhoods in Hyde Park, Bronzeville, Lincoln Park, and Uptown. Because there is no video evidence of this action, the value of the items taken and destroyed is unknown, contrasting media emphasis on the monetary cost of direct actions (while ignoring the cost of poverty, displacement, etc.).",

    "Description (short paragraph about the piece) Not required": "This project had a direct relationship to a critique conversation about an assignment called The Expanded book Project, in which I created a sculpture to embody the sequential reality of a mirror. I used broken shards of glass and large globs of paint to create rough textures that contrasted with a more playful, and pale color palette. I wanted to see how far I could twist imagery in order to transform a color palette that usually demonstrates a calming tone into one that evokes an uneasy feeling, mirroring the horrifying reality of the repetition of visuals and reflections in mirrors. At the end of this critique, an artist that was involved in my group generated a prompt that could be completed in an hour. The prompt was along the lines of; make some sort of animation or stop motion playing off of the color scheme of pastel colors that still convey a sense of creepiness. The animation can be as short as 3 seconds. And so, this video is the material result of this challenge.  ",

I made the soft sculpture pod form to reference a comforter, a symbol of home and comfort which had also changed during my transition into the dorms, but subverted it through its construction. The overstuffing of the pod sections cause an object that should be comfortable to feel suffocating. My interaction with this sculpture in the video spanning multiple locations is representative of the discomfort I felt when I came to SAIC. Art school, a place I had idealized for so long as being the space where I would actually belong, felt lonely. I did not feel like myself in my first month here. I retreated into myself in social interactions due to my discomfort instead of being my regular confident self. I felt as though I was missing out, but slowly I became more comfortable again. This short film illustrates my progression from my isolation and identity crisis to finally feeling a sense of self and belonging again during that time through my insertion and emergence from the pod form.
