    "Description (short paragraph about the piece) Not required": "In my piece, I Don’t Have To Smile To Be Pretty, I took inspiration from Barbara Kruger’s photograph We Will Not Become What We Mean To You and focused on how men in society view women. I specifically focused on the phrase men think we need which is “You’re too pretty not to smile”. I then gave a response back to that unneeded phrase with “I don’t have to smile to be pretty” which became the name of this piece. I want this piece to give attention to gender based street harassment and sexism, while also giving women the confidence to take control back of their bodies. This piece is a self portrait done in black and white with similar drapery to that of Barbara Kruger’s piece and text that runs across the middle of the image. Even though this is a self portrait I wanted to make this relatable to anyone that has dealt with some form of gender based street harassment. I made this more relatable by framing the image from the tip of the nose down the abdomen so that the viewer doesn’t think it’s specifically related to the person in the image since there is a missing recognizable feature which is the eyes. \n",

Instead of looking out upon the horizon, I set my gaze on the ground in this plein air study. There, one finds discarded, ugly, and artificial objects that contrast the idealized imagery presented in popular depictions of natural landscapes. Objects such as plastic bags, cigarette butts, and a receipt are represented in the form of soft sculpture featuring embroidery, a careful and time consuming process, in contrast to the stretched artificial grass surface. Giving these objects special care through intentional handmade construction emphasizes the problematic nature of the synthetic objects that surround us as a result of human carelessness. At the same time the plastic likeness of the natural ground creates a sense of irony. This is resulting from the exchange of roles between the materials used to represent trash and nature. All of this allows us to reexamine the nature of our thoughtless ways, our priorities, and the concept of beauty.   \n",

    "Description (short paragraph about the piece) Not required": "Many products we use in our regular lives have a history of labor exploitation from developing countries. Still, a lot of prestigious global corporations still pay their workers from Third World nations far lower than products sold in developed countries. They are forced to work harshly for longer hours without eating properly, resting, or even receiving wages, but there is no sign of improvement. A coffee bean and cacao are the representative resources, including labor exploitation. They rank first and second in trade, respectively, for indulgent foods, which people eat for pleasure but not vital. There is a well-known story that many workers have never eaten the expensive coffee or chocolate although they had first produced them. However, a lot of consumers in developed countries still disagree with fair trade and seek to eat food at a low price. From my artworks, I want to satirize how we (and the models in the pics), the developed countries' consumers and also corporations, neglect the exploitation of labor forces from developing countries while enjoying indulgent foods. They are luxuries. ",

    "Description (short paragraph about the piece) Not required": "A portrayal of my experience of grieving both the fat body I lost to a restrictive eating disorder and the \"shredded\" body I will never be able to achieve without one. Representative of my process of losing roughly one-third of my total body weight during my most recent relapse, I took two photographs of my body and sliced them into strips, then reconstructed them into three photos, each two-thirds of their original size. While the portraits are thinner, they are also unrecognizable-- they are not fully human. Recognizing the emotional and physical harm my eating disorder has caused over the years, these portraits also demonstrate the only way I will be able to achieve a \"shredded\" body while staying alive.",

I exhibit a collection of texts that forms an “essay” of evidence that is presented to the viewer in an interactive 3D sphere.  The sphere is made of two halves.  One half presents the pro-choice argument using texts from the transcripts of the landmark supreme court case, Roe vs. Wade, 1973.  The other half presents texts from Row vs. Wade’s appellee argument.  The two halves are bound together with yarn, but can be loosened and removed to split the “cell” form, creating a visual representation of what occurs post-conception in the womb.  The ball structure is created by twisting plaster gauze into cords and stretching them over a beach ball.  They are reinforced with plaster of paris, yarn, and more gauze.  The sphere is 3 feet in diameter.  When separated, the pieces are 6 feet in length, 2.5 feet high, and 3 feet in depth. \n",

I suffer from depression and anxiety, so I've been doing a lot of work revolving around these types of experiences. This piece is a self-portrait about my perception of self doubt. Depression has the symptoms of hopelessness and doubting one's self. After taking the time to heal, I started to realize that many traumatic events were not my fault. \"Blinded Chaos\" is about consciously not realizing how much pain there can be within trauma. On one side (the mirrored side on the left) is how I viewed myself (the silhouette). It is a messy, chaotic figure that just exists in a world that is superior. The other side (the non- mirrored side) contains the reality of a chaotic world where I was just existing.\nI wanted to push the boundaries of composition with the use of texture and shape, and reality. This piece represents me, my mental well being, and the love I have for combining opposite techniques together.",

    "Description (short paragraph about the piece) Not required": "What We Lack is an exploration of things that we lack. We must go through life in the Not Having of things, and that is okay. Sometimes that absence is acutely felt. Sometimes it is for the better. We lose things; things are taken from us; we give things; some things we never had. The skeletal forms of objects out of metal wire each represent a different type of lack, suspended in a cobweb of thread– an ephemeral state of Being and Not Being. There is a penny, which is a generous, hopeful lack. I have a friend that never keeps pennies because she likes to leave them places, heads up, for a stranger to find. She is putting luck and optimism into the world through the absence of the pennies in her possession. The book is a given, bonding lack. I have a habit of always annotating books as I read them, not in an academic sense, but just articulating my thoughts and feelings, doodling and marking down jokes and things that I’m reminded of as I read. It is a very deep and personal thing for me to share books with a friend; it is baring my soul through the story and inviting them to do the same. A book I share is filled with pieces of me– the lack is an exchange for a bond. The umbrella is the lack of never having. I’ve never carried an umbrella. I like to feel the raindrops on my head, it makes me feel closer to the world. It is a lack that allows for closeness with something greater. Physical space creates room for a transcendent intimacy.

Constantly defining a woman’s purpose, her role, expectations of availability. To “serve”, to “pleasure”, to “perform” someone else’s interests. The female body, is neglected and abused far too often. Our parts are our own, my parts are our own. Variations are beautiful, not “shameful”.  Society drills in foolish expectations. These ideas, absorbed from what is around you, are horrifying poisons to the mind.  \nA figure with a mask, a face congested with deep frustration. A face that is glued onto the body rather than painted on; a disconnection with your physical being. A sense of shame, of embarrassment, a discomfort in your own skin, an uneasy detachment, poisoned by society. The figure is contorted into itself, the elbow jabbing backwards into the hip, attempting to feel, to touch, to be connected with itself again. She floats as a ghost, lost in herself. ",

Sugar has gone through periods of rarity and desirability. During wars, sugar skyrocketed in price and became a very hot commodity. Today sugar is cheap and quite easy to get your hands on, although, during the beginning of the pandemic, sugar was nowhere to be found in grocery stores once again raising the desirability. I wanted to show that a material such as sugar, which is cheap and messy generally, can be transformed into something intriguing and thought-provoking. I researched glass purses and felt they were a ridiculous level of non-functioning for such a functioning item and wanted to recreate that feeling.",

Who represents America?\nAs an Asian American woman, is my voice being heard in my country?\nWhen will I feel accepted? When will they accept me? What does the flag represent today? Is the American flag a symbol of hate and white supremacy now? How can we redefine the flag to represent Americans? The flag should represent love, freedom, unity, and justice but the country doesn’t fulfill this title. Maybe we shouldn’t be wearing the flag so much with pride and ignorance. These days, there is a negative connotation and judgement towards those that wave the American flag or stand up in pride to pledge their allegiance to the flag. It seems to now represent white America and the ignorance, hate, and injustice towards minorities. I am the voice and face of an American. This is my home. I was born in this country and yes, I speak English. When will we feel safe and secured? \n",

    "Description (short paragraph about the piece) Not required": "A self-portrait with a papier-mâché sculpture inspired by Will Wood's 2015 album \"Everything is a Lot\". Created out of COVID era newspapers, the sculpture functions as a hollow vase rendered in the form of an abstract skull. Sporting fake (yet carefully chosen) flowers and a real tangerine, the symbolic implications paired with the passage of time reveals a particularly pessimistic sentiment of the current global circumstances despite the outward appearance of healing, renewal and beauty. The artist, dressed in solemn garb, interacts with the sculpture for further implications, grappling with the various forms of death pervasive throughout the pandemic scene.",
