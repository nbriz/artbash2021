The following project revolves around the dream of the own house that many people share. To make this situation visible, this project takes form through a an improvised house made with cardboard, tape, and metal wires. The result of this work is a structure that portrays certain instability and fragility.\nI intend to portray this as an action in order to a parallel between the resilience implied in this act in spite of its context and the resistance of the structure despite its conditions. The title of the project portrays the container property of the box, which not only houses people; but also  represents the adaptability of people trough the malleability of the material.\n ",
