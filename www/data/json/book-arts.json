I created a packaging label in which I branded the cat-meat as a women’s health food.  This is a comment on my irritation with the exploitation of fear and desire in marketing.  I stuffed the cat toy with protein powder and women’s Vita Health vitamins.  I also performed with my sculpture by boiling the cat toy as if it was in a soup.  The folding technique I used makes the book also a performative experience for the viewer.  Each book has a styrofoam base made from the original cat-meat sculpture to simulate the same texture and experience for the viewer.  \n",

Like a web of images and ideas that is continuously distorted.  So, with this small project, I played with how I could manipulate my collection of images into new forms that coincide with the words that I write in my journal. ",

    "Description (short paragraph about the piece) Not required": "Between the beginning of the pandemic and quarantine, the end of high school, and the beginning of college, my body has changed quite a bit. This succession of drastic changes caused me to gain some weight as I developed a new relationship with food within a newly sedentary lifestyle. The way that I visually present myself has also shifted in this new stage of my life. This has left me with a body that I no longer recognize and that I am still working to get acquainted with and embrace. I know that this just another one of the many changes that my body has gone through and will continue to go through as I live and age. To commemorate this particular stage, I have made molds of the various parts of my body that have undergone this current change. In these molds, I casted multiple flavors of jello. This video shows the way I interact with and touch these sculptures to demonstrate their movement and how that movement mirrors the way my own body acts. I stop in between takes to consume the parts of the body that have changed as a result of my own consumption, creating a sarcastic take on diet culture and giving an intimate look at my own struggles with body image.
